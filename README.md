Submission for KJSCE Hack 5.0 , April 2021.

**## About:**
An effortless web application to display transparent medical records of any given patient. 
In this, any verified  Medical professional can fetch in the complete medical history of his/her patient and get to know the background better. The records will give information like 
a. Date of Visit
b. Doctor Visited
c. Problem diagnosed
d. Medicines prescribed

**## Advantages:**
1. This will surely help the doctor in cases where the diagnosis is based on history of the patient.
2. The trend in the drugs prescribed will help treat the patient better
3. We aim to make the entire system centralized with the help of the government of India by connecting the medical history of the patient with aadhar card number
4 The patient can fetch his/her record even if he/she changes his doctor.
5 This will smoothen the process of visa exchange in cases where medical history is required
6. This centralized database system is the need of an hour as a treatment for covid varies greatly on the medical history of the patient
7. Knowing oneâ€™s family medical history allows a person to take steps to reduce his or her risk. For people at an increased risk of certain cancers, healthcare professionals may recommend more frequent screening (such as mammography or colonoscopy) starting at an earlier age. Our project is a viable solution for the same
